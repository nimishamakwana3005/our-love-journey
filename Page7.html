    <h1>💌 To My Most Precious Ashu 💜</h1>
    <div class="letter">
      <p>Seven months. It sounds a short time to some, but to me, it’s 210 days of realizing that my favorite place in the world is wherever you are. 🌍💞</p>
      <p>From our very first month to this beautiful Valentine’s Day 🌹, you have turned my ordinary days into something extraordinary. ✨</p>
      <p>I look back at our “photo dumps” — the blurry laughs 📸, the quiet coffee dates ☕, and the way you look at me when you think I’m not noticing 🥹 — and I feel like the luckiest person alive. 🍀💗</p>
      <p>You aren't just my boyfriend; you are my safe harbor ⚓, my biggest laugh 😂, and my best friend. 🤍</p>
      <p>Thank you for choosing me every day for the last seven months. 🫶</p>
      <p>Thank you for the way you love me. 💕</p>
      <p>As these rose petals fall across the screen 🌸, know that my love for you is growing even faster. 💜</p>
      <p>Happy Valentine’s Day 🌹 and Happy 7-Month Anniversary, my love. 💌<br>Here is to a lifetime of pages yet to be written. 📖✨<br>Forever yours,<br>Nimisha💞</p>
